This respositery provides the created codes for claculating LST using Landsat in GEE
LST is a controlling factor in water and energy exchange between the atmosphere and earth surface.
 Here, LST is evaluated using Landsat missions (Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data) for the SCRS. 
 In this study, the emissivity method (described in the Landsat Science Data Users Handbook) is implemented in the Google earth engine (GEE) to retrieve LST (Nasa;2012 n.d.).
 GEE is a platform for scientist analysis which provides a ready-to-use editor to test different algorithm and quickly see the results (Gorelick et al. 2017).
